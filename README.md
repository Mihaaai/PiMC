Pi Monitor & Control 

A nodeJS server sits on the Raspberry Pi. It will serve users the webpage where they can control and monitor the Pi sensors.
At this moment, we only monitor temperature through a dedicated GPIO sensor.
Sensor information is gathered with a python script.

Currently working on : transfering values from python with a socket to the nodeJS server.

Current issue : We lack an raspberry Pi, our support teacher got his back for now.
